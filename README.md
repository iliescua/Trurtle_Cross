# Trurtle_Cross
This is a take on the popular road crossing game where you have to navigate from the bottom of the screen to the top of the screen while avoiding obstacles.

### How to play
Use the up and down arrow keys to move the player turtle across the screen. If the game ends simply restart it by pressing space. The farther you progress the faster the
obstacles come towards you.
